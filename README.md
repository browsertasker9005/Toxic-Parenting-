# Toxic-Parenting-
No one has the perfect parent but when you have a toxic parent it would affect the whole being of a child and this child have many personality issues. If you watch "Dahmer" a Netflix series. You will understand what I want to convey. Raising a child is no joke, be mature and ready enough before rushing to become a parent.
